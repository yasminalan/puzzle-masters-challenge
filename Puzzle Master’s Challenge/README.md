Greetings, Codebreaker.

Your mind is your only tool. The shell is your only weapon.

In each directory, a new mystery.  Only the sharp escape.

In each LEVEL, a chance to prove your worth.

There is a prize at the end.

Welcome to LEVEL 1

I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but not go outside. What am I?
